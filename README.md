## Setting up the environement

### With virtual environment:
If you work with a python environement (which I highly recommand), you will have to create an environement using eather [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which is a build-in module in python3 or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), which can be installed using the following commande `pip install virtualenv`.

After installing the environment (you can check the documentation of the package), and activating it you can use the commande `pip install -r requirement.txt`.

### Global installation:

Run the commande `pip install -r requirement.txt`.
